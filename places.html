    <h2 id="ananthapura">Ananthapura Lake Temple</h2>
    <div class="place-box">
      <div class="place-card">
        <p>As the name suggests, Ananthapura Lake Temple is located in the middle of a lake in the village of Ananthapura. It is an ancient 
          temple believed to have been built in the 9th century. It is the only lake temple in Kerala and is known as the moolasthanam 
          (the original abode) of Lord Padmanabha of Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple of Thiruvananthapuram. The main deity of Lord Mahavishnu 
          is found to be in a sitting posture here unlike the Ananthashayanam posture in Sree Padmanabhaswamy temple in Thiruvananthapuram. 
          The deity is seated on the serpent king Anantha. The temple also displays impressive wood carvings on the ceilings of the 
          mandapam that depict the stories of dasaavatharam (ten incarnations of Lord Vishnu). To reach the temple, one has to take the 
          deviation from Nayakkap on the Kumbala-Badiadka road.</p>

    <h2 id="bekal-fort">Bekal Fort</h2>
    <div class="place-box">
      <div class="place-card">
        <p>Bekal Fort is a historical structure built in the 17th century and has itself become part of an identity of the district. 
          It is situated in Pallikara village of Kasaragod on a headland that spans up to 35 km.It is believed that the fort was originally 
          constructed by rulers of the ancient Kadampa dynasty and the power changed hands over the years to Kolathiri Rajas, Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan 
          and finally to the British East India Company. The lofty, circular laterite structure of the fort that stands at a height of 130 feet is 
          shaped like a giant keyhole. The walls around rise to 12 metres in height. The highlights include tall observation towers which presumably 
          would have been occupied by gigantic cannons until a few centuries ago, a water tank with its flight of steps and a tunnel that opens 
          towards the south. The architectural beauty of the fort also met the defence requirements of various rulers,which was the main reason for 
          the fort’s existence. There are also some pilgrim attractions nearby like the Lord Hanuman temple and an old Mosque which is believed to be 
          built by Tippu Sultan.The Bekal beach is only a kilometre away from the fort which offers an enticing view of the imposing fort. It has now 
          become a favoured destination for weddings, ad shoots and filmmakers for its picturesque location. This is the largest and the 
          best-preserved fort in the district and is now maintained by the Archaeological Department of Government of India.</p>

    <h2 id="chandragiri-fort">Chandragiri Fort</h2>
    <div class="place-box">
      <div class="place-card">
        <p>Chandragiri Fort is another historical landmark in the district situated in the south-east of Kasaragod town. The Chandragiri River that
          flows nearby once bordered the kingdoms of Kolathunadu and Tulunadu. The origin of the fort goes back to the times of Keladi Nayakas who 
          took control of the region as the Vijayanagara Empire fell. Shivappa Nayak secured his empire by renovating and constructing many forts 
          around the area one of which is Chandragiri which was built in the 17th century. The remnants of the fort which can be seen on a small 
          hill overlook the estuary where the Payaswini River joins the Arabian Sea. The old laterite walls around the fort still bear marks of 
          cannonball attacks. The ancient Kizhur Sastha temple and a mosque are situated near the fort. The fort is now maintained by the Archaeology 
          Department of India. Boat services are available here that will take you to nearby islands and palm groves. Speed boat rides,houseboat 
          cruises, island camping and wildlife tours in the hinterlands can also be arranged.</p>

    <h2 id="malik">Malik Ibn Dinar Mosque</h2>
    <div class="place-box">
      <div class="place-card">
        <p>Malik Ibn Dinar Mosque, located at Thalankara, was built by Malik Ibn Dinar who was one among the first to bring Islam to India. 
          Along with their trade, Malik Ibn Dinar and his associates also propagated Islam in Kerala which even fascinated the then ruler Cheraman 
          Perumal, who is believed to have embraced the religion. One of the earliest mosques built in Kerala, the structure displays a typical 
          Kerala architecture style, with intricate wooden carvings in Arabic etched on the massive beams and pillars. The details of the history 
          of construction can also be interpreted from the latticed woodwork. The mosque has been extensively renovated over the years, which was 
          initially a small structure with a thatched roof. There’s also a grave nearby which is supposed to be of a member of Dinar’s family, but 
          some historians opine that the tomb is of Malik Ibn Dinar himself.The main celebration here is the Uroos festival that commemorates 
          the arrival of Ibn Dinar in Kasaragod.</p>

    <h2 id="nileswaram">Nileswaram</h2>
    <div class="place-box">
      <div class="place-card">
        <p>Nileswaram holds adequate significance in the map of Kasaragod as it is rightly known as the cultural capital of the district. 
          The place used to be the headquarters of the Nileshwar rajas. The Kovilakoms or Palaces of the rajas gives us a glimpse of the 
          architectural brilliance and mastery of woodworks sculpted in those times.  The Thekke Kovilakom, Kinavoor Kovilakom, Kovilakom Chira 
          and the Tali temple associated with the royal family are some of them. Nileswaram palace now functions as the folklore centre of the 
          Department of Archaeology. Nileswaram is home to many folk arts and culture and is also known for the numerous kavus (shrines), temple 
          festivals and its handloom industries. Mannan Purathu kavu is the important kavu here where the annual temple festival is held, that 
          draws in large crowds.</p>
